### ‚úÖ In simple words:

> **Every HTML element becomes an object in the DOM**,  
> and **we can perform operations** (read, change, delete, add) on those objects **at runtime using JavaScript.**

---

### üìö For example:

In your HTML:

```html
<h1 id="title">Welcome</h1>
```

In the DOM (once the page loads), this becomes a JS object:

```js
let heading = document.getElementById("title");
```

Now `heading` is an **object** that represents your `<h1>` tag, and you can do things like:

- `heading.textContent = "Hello, Elara!";` ‚Üí Changes the text
- `heading.style.color = "blue";` ‚Üí Changes the color
- `heading.classList.add("fancy");` ‚Üí Adds a CSS class
- `heading.remove();` ‚Üí Deletes the element from the page

### üîÅ Runtime = After the page loads

JavaScript reads the DOM after your page loads, so you can update the page **without refreshing**, based on user interaction, time, API response, etc.



> **‚ÄúIn the DOM, every element in HTML is treated as an object that can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript at runtime.‚Äù**

### Real Life Examples of DOM Usage:


 To-Do App: Add tasks, mark them complete, delete them.

Weather App: Show data from API and update DOM with temperature, humidity, etc.

Form Validation: Alert users when fields are empty or invalid.

Dark Mode: Toggle background and text colors.

Interactive Menus, Modals, Sliders, Carousels, etc.
