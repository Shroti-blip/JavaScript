You’re basically implementing classical inheritance in JavaScript using constructor functions and prototypes (before ES6 introduced `class` syntax).

---

### 🧠 What’s the Goal Here?

You’re trying to create a structure where:

- `Animal` is a **parent constructor function**.
- `Dog` is a **child constructor function** that inherits from `Animal`.
- You want a dog to be able to both:
  - Say hello (inherited from Animal).
  - Bark (specific to Dog).

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Parent Constructor Function: `Animal`**
```js
function Animal(name){
    this.name = name;
}
```
- This is a constructor function.
- When you create a new `Animal("Tom")`, the object gets a `name` property.

```js
Animal.prototype.sayHello = function(){
    document.write("hello , i am " + this.name);
};
```
- This adds a method `sayHello` to **Animal’s prototype**.
- So all objects created using `new Animal()` will have access to this method.

---

### 🔁 What is `prototype`?

Every function in JavaScript has a `prototype` property — an object that holds methods and properties to be **shared** among all instances created by that function.

So:
```js
Animal.prototype.sayHello = ...
```
Means:
> "Every `Animal` (or object that inherits from Animal) should have this method."

---

#### 2. **Child Constructor Function: `Dog`**
```js
function Dog(name, breed){
    Animal.call(this, name);  // call parent constructor with current 'this'
    this.breed = breed;
}
```
- You’re calling the `Animal` constructor inside the `Dog` constructor using `.call()`.
- `this` refers to the new Dog object being created.
- So `Dog` gets both a `name` (from Animal) and a `breed`.

---

#### 3. **Inheritance Setup**
```js
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
```

Let’s understand this line-by-line:

- `Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);`
  - This makes the **Dog prototype chain point to Animal's prototype**.
  - So `Dog` inherits `sayHello` from `Animal`.

- `Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;`
  - This fixes the `constructor` property (which was overwritten by `Object.create`).
  - Now `dog.constructor` points back to `Dog`, not `Animal`.

---

#### 4. **Add Method Specific to Dog**
```js
Dog.prototype.bark = function(){
    document.write(this.name + " says woof");
}
```
- Only `Dog` objects will have access to `bark`, not general `Animal`s.

---

### 🐶 Creating a Dog
```js
let dog = new Dog("buddy", "Golden Retriever");
dog.sayHello(); // inherited from Animal
dog.bark();     // defined in Dog
```

This results in:
```
hello , i am buddybuddy says woof
```
(on the page)

---

### 🔗 Visual of the Inheritance Chain:

```
dog -> Dog.prototype -> Animal.prototype -> Object.prototype
```

- `dog.sayHello()` → not found on dog, looks at `Dog.prototype`, not found → goes to `Animal.prototype`, found ✅
- `dog.bark()` → found on `Dog.prototype` ✅

### 🌟 Summary

| Concept | What it Does |
|--------|--------------|
| `constructor function` | Template to create objects (`Animal`, `Dog`) |
| `this` | Refers to the object being created |
| `.call()` | Invokes a function, specifying `this` manually |
| `.prototype` | Shared space for methods across instances |
| `Object.create()` | Creates a new object that inherits from the given prototype |
| `constructor` | Points back to the original constructor function |

Want me to show you how this would look with modern ES6 `class` syntax too? It's cleaner and easier to follow.
